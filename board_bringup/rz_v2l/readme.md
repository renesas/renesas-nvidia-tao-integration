# RZ/V2L EVKit Quick Setup Overview

Setting up the RZ/V2L platform involves two main tasks:

1. **Installing the RZ/V2L AI SDK on an Ubuntu host machine** â€” used for model conversion and deployment via the GUI.
2. **Preparing the RZ/V2L EVKit** â€” including hardware connections and SD card setup.

## ðŸ”§ Setup Overview

For detailed instructions, refer to the [RZ/V AI GitHub repository](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/latest/getting_started.html). Be sure to select the latest version from the top-left dropdown. Here's a quick summary:

### âœ… Step-by-Step Summary

- **Steps 1â€“2**: Acquire the board and required components (see table below).
- **Steps 3â€“5**: Download the RZ/V2L AI SDK and set up the Docker container. For optimal performance, use **DRP-AI TVM v2.5**.
- **Step 7**: Format the microSD card and flash the bootloader and Yocto image. This is essential for new boards or SDK updates. Ensure you have partitioned your microsD card appropriately.
- **Final Setup**: Connect the board as shown in *Figure below*. Note: SW1 & SW11 switch orientation depends on your bootloader choice (eSD/eMMC).
- **Shutdown**: Follow the [safe shutdown procedures](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/latest/appendix.html#A3).


> **Note:** On your board, check if libtvm_runtime.so exists under /usr/lib64 directory of the root filesystem of the board. If not copy from docker â€˜/drp-ai_tvm/obj/build_runtime/V2L/â€™ folder path to board under /usr/lib64 via secure copy.
