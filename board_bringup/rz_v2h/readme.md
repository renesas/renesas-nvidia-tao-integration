# RZ/V2H EVKit Quick Setup Overview

Setting up the RZ/V2H platform involves two main tasks:

1. **Installing the RZ/V2H AI SDK on an Ubuntu host machine** â€” used for model conversion and deployment via the GUI.
2. **Preparing the RZ/V2H EVKit** â€” including hardware connections and SD card setup.

## ðŸ”§ Setup Overview

For detailed instructions, refer to the [RZ/V AI GitHub repository](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/latest/getting_started.html). Be sure to select the latest version from the top-left dropdown. Here's a quick summary:  
>**Important note:** AI SDK V5.20 for RZ/V2H lags behind the latest DRP-AI TVM v2.5 library and DRP-AI Translator version, in order to get ~30 ms inference performance for Detectnetv2 pipeline, ensure updating the DockerFile and DRP-AI Translator binary.

### âœ… Step-by-Step Summary

- **Steps 1â€“2**: Acquire the board and required components (see table below).
- **Steps 3â€“4**: Download the RZ/V2H AI SDK and set up the Docker container. For optimal performance, use **DRP-AI TVM v2.5**. 
- **Steps 4.5**:Before set up and after downloading and unzipping the AI SDK folder, for V2H, the AI SDK v5.20 should be patched for best performance as follows:
    - In ``ai_sdk_setup`` directory, please replace ``DRP-AI_Translator_i8-v1.02-Linux-x86_64-Install`` with ``DRP-AI_Translator_i8-v1.10-Linux-x86_64-Install``that can be installed from [here](https://www.renesas.com/en/software-tool/drp-ai-translator-i8#overview). 
    - Please replace the DockerFile in ``ai_sdk_setup`` with the one that can be downloaded via the following command:
    ``` 
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renesas-rz/rzv_drp-ai_tvm/main/DockerfileV2H -O DockerfileV2H
- **Step 5**: Continue with the steps described in [RZ/V AI GitHub repository](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/latest/getting_started.html).
- **Step 7**: Format the microSD card and flash the bootloader and Yocto image. This is essential for new boards or SDK updates. Ensure you have partitioned your microsD card appropriately.
- **Final Setup**: Connect the board as shown in *Figure below*. Note: DSW1 & DSW2 switch orientation depends on your bootloader choice (eSD/eMMC).
- **Shutdown**: Follow the [safe shutdown procedures](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/latest/appendix.html#A3).


> **Note:** On your board, check if libtvm_runtime.so exists under /usr/lib64 directory of the root filesystem of the board. If not copy from docker â€˜/drp-ai_tvm/obj/build_runtime/V2H/â€™ folder path to board under /usr/lib64 via secure copy.
